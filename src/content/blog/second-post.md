Greetings, everyone!

I've added a new tab on the header,  labelled 'photos'.
It contains some of my favourite photos I've taken over the years using no other than my iPhone XR (which I just sold to get the 13 Pro lmao)
This was done using Astro 4.0's simplified layout, which allowed me to easily code this.
I'm also thinking of adding some sort of button or script that allows me to upload new photos directly to the website instead of having to manually add photos to the code and commit and push to the git every time.
I have so many ideas to implement here and the journey just started so I'm super excited!!
