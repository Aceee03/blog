		Hello! I'm Wadie <br>
		I'm a junior computer science student at ESTIN (Bejaia,
		Algeria) <br> I have a heart for anything tech related but web development
		and AI especially. <br> Outside of coding, you'll often find me immersed in
		the world of gaming. <br>
		I'm also an avid football fan, whether it's playing on the field or cheering for my favourite team, FC Barcelona. <br>
		Let's connect through this basic website I built!!
